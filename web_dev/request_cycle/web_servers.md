What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

Unix was designed to build simple, short, clear, modular, and extensible code that can be easily maintained and repurposed.

The Unix Philosophy:
Small is beautiful.
Make each program do one thing well.
Build a prototype as soon as possible.
Choose portability over efficiency.
Store data in flat text files.
Use software leverage to your advantage.
Use shell scripts to increase leverage and portability.
Avoid captive user interfaces.
Make every program a filter.

A virtual private server is an OS on a virtual machine that can be controlled from a users terminal.
Advantages include super-user accessability, disposability, and affordability.

Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
Because you can accidentally cause massive permanent damage.
