# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful? Version control lets us view and merge revisions made by different programmers. 
* What is a branch and why would you use one? A branch is the work that someone is doing that hasn't been merged with the master yet.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? A commit is a save point on a branch. A good commit message gives details about the changes made to the branch.
